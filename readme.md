Readme under progress as I have not decided what to make yet. My implementation only covers raid 5 for now.

Update 1 - Adding RAID 0, 1 and 5 as logic is reusable from 0 to all. Will implement others as required.

Update 2 - Implemented RAID but logical block address. 

Update 3 - Will need controller state index management for lba
